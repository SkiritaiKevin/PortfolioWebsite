        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
            <p>I am deeply passionate about cybersecurity. I am
                particularly interested in offensive security
                (red team), defensive security (blue team), ethical
                hacking, network defense, and AI-driven security
                practices. My overall technical interests include
                penetration testing (projects tab has research on
                this!), exploit development, security architecture,
                vulnerability research, digital forensics, and the
                intersection between AI systems and defense mechanisms
                within cybersecurity. I'm a hardworking person
                committed to continuous learning in threat detection,
                network protection, and building resilient systems
                in a technological advancing world.

            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>I've always been into video games. I grew up with the GameCube and Wii which shaped a lot of my early
                love for Technology
                and entertainment. I own and collect many Nintendo
                consoles including the NES, Gameboy, Nintendo 64, GameCube,
                DS, 3DS, Wii, and Switch. I transitioned to Xbox 360 and PS4 during my
                teenage years, and now I mainly game on PC when I get the time, currently
                playing VALORANT the most.

                <br><br>My favorite game of all time is <em>Super Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door</em>. Outside of
                gaming, I love traveling. One of my main life goals is to visit every country possible. Soccer has
                always been my favorite sport, especially when the World Cup comes on every four years. I'm also big on
                movies and TV shows. Some recent watches I'd recommend are <em>Dexter</em> and <em>Prison Break</em>. If
                I had to recommend the best show I've ever watched, it's an anime called <em>Death Note</em>.

                <br><br>I have a growing passion for fashion. I love to find pieces I like and thrifting for clothing
                has become a hobby of mine.
