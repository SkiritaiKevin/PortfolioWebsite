            <h2>How We Met &amp; Started Collaborating</h2>
            <p>
                I met Derrick Tarver (CEO) with my professor <strong>Dr. Yang Wang</strong> at the 
                <strong>Community-Driven Research Day (2024)</strong> in Philadelphia.
                We kicked off a year-long partnership soon after, meeting regularly to scope features and
                solve problems together.

                <h2>My Role: Gamification Lead</h2>
                <p>
                    I worked on the <strong>gamification</strong> layer of the app. My inspiration comes from early 
                    experiences with <em>First In Math</em> at St. Matthew School-weekly top-3 announcements, badges,
                    and a friendly competitive atmosphere made learning exciting. I wanted to bring that 
                    same joy into TCBMe.

                <p>
                    Received a <strong>$10,000 USD grant</strong> to research gamification, applying findings to a 
                    mental health application for youth on TCBMe's <strong>Circle</strong> platform community. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <strong>2025</strong>, I presented this work at the 
                    <strong>Philadelphia Trauma Training Conference</strong> (Thomas Jefferson University).

                I'm excited to continue expanding the gamified experience-richer challenges, team-based goals,
                and analytics to keep learners engaged and supported as the platform grows. Any
